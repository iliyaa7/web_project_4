# web_project_4 by Iliya Gomon

In this project I have built a small "Social Network".
<br>This "Social Network" is a front-end responsive web application, that all its functionality was written with vanilla JS following the OOP paradigm.
I have built a scalable validation class that checks all the forms in this project and connected this web page to a 3rd party API for storing and manipulating the users data.

That was a good practice of writing an asynchronous code, using classes, learning about event listeners and using the object oriented programming principles.
