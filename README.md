# web_project_4 by Iliya Gomon

This is my forth project at the yandex web development course.

In this project I built a responsive "Social Network" according to a layout/spec in the "Figama" designers tool.
In this "Social Network" page i made a form that popus out when you press a button and and made one of the "Like" buttons change its color when activated. I made it possible via java script.
I used varubels, objects, dom selector, function, conditions and event listeners in oreder to make all the above happen.

In the near future I am planning to make all the like buttons change thier color while active and add more java script features to page.
